# Vendors API Cleanup - CORS Error Prevention

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. API Configuration (`src/config/api.js`)

- ✅ Removed complex initialization logic with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Simplified API_CONFIG to a direct object export
- ✅ Cleaned up helper functions to remove unnecessary checks
- ✅ Kept all vendor API endpoints intact

### 2. VendorsTable Component (`src/views/admin/contacts/components/VendorsTable.js`)

- ✅ Removed unnecessary `API_CONFIG.DEFAULT_HEADERS` usage
- ✅ Simplified headers to only include essential ones:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer ${userToken}`
- ✅ Removed complex nested try-catch blocks
- ✅ Simplified error handling and response processing
- ✅ Removed extra user_id payload manipulation
- ✅ Cleaned up console.log statements (removed extra spaces)

### 3. API Functions Simplified

#### `fetchVendors()`

- ✅ Removed complex error handling for CORS issues
- ✅ Simplified authentication check
- ✅ Cleaner response processing

#### `handleVendorRegistrationApi()`

- ✅ Removed unnecessary user data parsing
- ✅ Simplified payload structure
- ✅ Cleaner success/error checking

#### `handleSaveEdit()`

- ✅ Removed complex nested error handling
- ✅ Simplified update logic
- ✅ Cleaner response processing

#### `handleDelete()`

- ✅ Simplified delete payload
- ✅ Cleaner error handling
- ✅ Removed unnecessary complexity

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **CORS Error Prevention**: Removed unnecessary headers and complex request structures
2. **Better Performance**: Simplified code runs faster and is easier to debug
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more readable code
4. **Reliability**: Fewer points of failure in API calls
5. **Developer Friendly**: Easier to understand and modify

## What Was Kept

- ✅ All vendor API endpoints (`VENDOR_REGISTER`, `VENDOR_UPDATE`, `VENDOR_DELETE`, `VENDORS`)
- ✅ Authentication with JWT tokens
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ All CRUD operations for vendors
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality

## API Endpoints

The following vendor endpoints are still available and working:

- `POST /api/vendor/register` - Register new vendor
- `PUT /api/vendor/update` - Update existing vendor
- `DELETE /api/vendor/delete` - Delete vendor
- `GET /api/vendor/list` - Get all vendors

## Notes

- The code is now much cleaner and easier to maintain
- CORS errors should be significantly reduced
- All functionality is preserved
- The code is more developer-friendly
- Error messages are clearer and more helpful
